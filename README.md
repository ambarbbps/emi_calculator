This is an HTML code for an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Calculator. The form in the code takes the loan amount, annual interest rate, and tenure as inputs from the user. The 'Calculate EMI' button calls the 'calculateEMI()' function, which calculates and displays the total interest to be paid, total payment, and EMI per month.

The styling of the page includes setting the background image, color, and font of the page, as well as formatting the input fields and button.
